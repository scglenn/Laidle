           By using the(DOM), they are able to read details of the web pages the browser visits, 
           make changes to them and pass information to their parent extension.

      [] - Added listener to handle incoming messages from javascript events sent from a page

      [] - Content scripts live in an isolated world, 
           allowing a content script to makes changes to its JavaScript environment without 
           conflicting with the page or additional content scripts.
